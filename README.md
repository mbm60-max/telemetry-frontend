# telemetry-frontend
Front end for gt sport pitwall project


### Purpose
This project takes inspiration from ATLAS (mclaren applied technolgies) and telemetry software like Motec and track titan. The aim was to create something between the last two. The project acts as both an experiment with c# and a test of my react and next js understanding. 

It is meant to act as a proof of concept for a semi-pro sim racer or sim racing team.
